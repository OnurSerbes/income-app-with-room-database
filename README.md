# income-app-with-room-database
Hello, welcome to my income-expanse app. 
In this application, I especially dealt with the details of database usage.
As a database, I preferred to use Room Database, which is SQL-based but a new database. It is more convenient and practical to use
After the database's build, you will see three different hierarchies. These hierarchies are the architecture of the room database
These are: Dao, Rapository and ViewModel
All methods in my fragments call functions from top hierarchy i.e. ViewModel

I hope it can be a helpful study that shows how you can customize the "Room Database" and "recyclerView" usage. 
Have a good coding :)
